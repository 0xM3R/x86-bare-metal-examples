== IO

You cannot use any libraries, so how to do IO? Some ways that this can be done:

* BIOS functions: http://wiki.osdev.org/BIOS. Not well standardized like it's successor UEFI. Called through interrupts.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA-compatible_text_mode
* VBE https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_BIOS_Extensions

Showdown and restart can be managed with either:

* APM
* ACPI https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface
+
Newer and better.
+
Now managed by the same group that manages UEFI.

** current: http://uefi.org/specifications
