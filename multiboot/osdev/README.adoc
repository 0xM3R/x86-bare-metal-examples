= osdev multiboot example

Originally from: http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones, should be a reasonable way to start a serious OS.

A hello world, with multiboot and a C interface.

The multiboot interface is prepared in GAS assembly.

Generates a bootable disk image by using `grub-mkrescue` on the multiboot binary.
