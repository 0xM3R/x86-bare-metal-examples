http://wiki.osdev.org/Non_Maskable_Interrupt

Interrupts generated by the CPU from 0 - 31 are not maskable: they generate interrupts even with `cli`.

Those from the PIC are maskable however.

QEMU generates many maskable interrupts by default. TODO: where do they come from? What are they excatly?

If we don't set a handler, we usually triple-fault and the machine restarts, thus going into a restart loop.
