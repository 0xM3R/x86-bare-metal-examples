/*
BIOS has a scroll function!

Very convenient, otherwise that would be hard to implement.

How it works:

Before scroll:

    a
     b
      c
       d

We then choose to act on the rectangle with corners
(1, 1) and (2, 2)} given by cx and dx:

    a
     XX
     XX
       d

and scroll that rectangle down by one line (al).

The final outcome is:

    a
      c
     NN
       d

where `N` are new squares generated by the scroll,
which gets filled with the background color in bh.
