[[small-educational-projects]]
=== Small educational projects

Fun, educational and useless:

* https://github.com/programble/bare-metal-tetris tested on Ubuntu 14.04. Just works.
+
Has Multiboot and El Torito. Uses custom linker script.
+
Almost entirely in C `-nostdlib`, with very few inline `asm` commands, and a small assembly entry point. So a good tutorial in how to do the bridge.
* https://github.com/daniel-e/tetros Tetris that fits into bootloader.
* https://github.com/arjun024/mkeykernel, https://github.com/arjun024/mkernel
+
Worked, but bad build system: not `Makefile` or `.gitignore`.
* https://github.com/Overv/MineAssemble

The following did not work on my machine out of the box:

* https://github.com/apparentlymart/ToyOS
* https://github.com/rde1024/toyos

=== Progressive tutorials

* http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html
+
Highly recommended.
+
Multiboot based kernels of increasing complexity, one example builds on the last one. Non DRY as a result.
+
Cleaned up source code: https://github.com/cirosantilli/jamesmolloy-kernel-development-tutorials
+
Well known bugs: http://wiki.osdev.org/James_Molloy's_Tutorial_Known_Bugs That's what happens when you don't use GitHub.
+
Good tutorials, author seems to master the subject.
+
But he could learn more about version control and build automation: source code inside ugly tar.gz with output files.
* https://sourceforge.net/p/oszur11/code/ci/master/tree/
+
GitHub mirror: https://github.com/cirosantilli/oszur11-operating-system-examples
+
Several examples of increasing complexity. Found at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7130726/writing-a-hello-world-kernel
+
Just works, but examples are non-minimal, lots of code duplication and blobs. There must be around 20 El Torito blobs in that repo.
+
Multiboot based.
* https://github.com/SamyPesse/How-to-Make-a-Computer-Operating-System
* http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html
* http://skelix.net/skelixos/index_en.html
+
Cleaned up version: https://github.com/cirosantilli/skelix-os
+
Not tested yet.
+
GAS based, no multiboot used.

=== Actually useful

These are not meant as learning resources but rather as useful programs:

* https://github.com/scanlime/metalkit A more automated / general bare metal compilation system. Untested, but looks promising.
* Python without an "OS": https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/378/
