    Does not seem standardized across to AMD.

    On Intel goes through the APIC to generate an interrupt across processors:

    > Wait-for-SIPI. As part of its initialization, the primary thread sends a special inter-processor-interrupt (IPI) over the APIC called a SIPI (Startup IPI) to each thread that is in WFS. The SIPI contains the address from which that thread should start fetching code.

-   Linux kernel `arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c`

-   newer Intel processors have an L2 shared across cores:

    Intel calls this "IntelÂ® Smart Cache".

    GPU competitor basically.

    One huge advantage: Phi is programmed with x86, unlike GPUs which have no low level API:

Nice quotes from Intel:

> The MP initialization protocol defines two classes of processors: the bootstrap processor (BSP) and the application
processors (APs). Following a power-up or RESET of an MP system, system hardware dynamically selects one of the
processors on the system bus as the BSP. The remaining processors are designated as APs.

> Following a power-up or reset, the APs complete a minimal self-configuration, then wait for a startup signal (a SIPI
message) from the BSP processor. Upon receiving a SIPI message, an AP executes the BIOS AP configuration code,
which ends with the AP being placed in halt state.

## AP

Application processor: all processors except the boot one.

## ICR

## Interrupt command register

When we write to it, interrupts are sent.

It is memory mapped to `0xFEE0 0300`.
